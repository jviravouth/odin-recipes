            Fried rice is a great way to use up leftovers; it is infinitely variable, and there are 
            <em>plenty</em> of variables worth testing out. Couple that with the number of rules that everyone
            says you simply must follow (you <em>must</em> use day-old rice, you <em>must</em> use medium-grain, et cetera)
            , and it seems like the perfect subject for some hardcore testing and myth-busting.

        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups cooked white rice (12 ounces; 350g)</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons (30ml) vegetable or canola oil, divided</li>
            <li>1 small onion, finely chopped (4 ounces; 115g)</li>
            <li>1 medium carrot, peeled and cut into small dice (3 ounces; 85g)</li>
            <li>2 scallions, thinly sliced (1 ounce; 30g)</li>
            <li>2 medium cloves garlic, minced (about 2 teaspoons; 5g)</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon (5ml) soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon (5ml) toasted sesame oil</li>
            <li>Kosher salt and ground white pepper</li>
            <li>1 large egg</1i>
            <li>4 ounces (115g) frozen peas</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Directions</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>If using day-old rice (see notes), transfer to a medium bowl and break rice up with
                your hands into individual grains before proceeding. Heat 1/2 tablespoon (7ml) vegetable oil in a wok
                over high heat until smoking. Add half of rice and cook, stirring and tossing, until rice is pale brown and toasted
                and has a lightly chewy texture, about 3 minutes. Transfer to a medium bowl. Repeat with another 1/2 tablespoon oil
                and remaining rice.

            <li>Return rice to wok and press it up the sides, leaving a space in the middle. Add 1/2 tablespoon (7ml)
                 oil to the space. Add onion, carrot, scallions and garlic and cook, stirring gently, until lightly 
                 softened and fragrant, about 1 minute. Toss with rice to combine. Add soy sauce and sesame oil and toss
                  to coat. Season to taste with salt and white pepper.

            <li>Push rice to the side of wok and add remaining 1/2 tablespoon (7ml) oil. Break egg into oil and season 
                with a little salt. Use a spatula to scramble egg, breaking it up into small bits. Toss egg and rice 
                together.

            <li>Add frozen peas and continue to toss and stir until peas are thawed and every grain of rice 
                is seperate. Serve immediately.
