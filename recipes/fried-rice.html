            Fried rice is a great way to use up leftovers; it is infinitely variable, and there are 
            <em>plenty</em> of variables worth testing out. Couple that with the number of rules that everyone
            says you simply must follow (you <em>must</em> use day-old rice, you <em>must</em> use medium-grain, et cetera)
            , and it seems like the perfect subject for some hardcore testing and myth-busting.
